			"site_description": "<p>Writer Kenneth Rexroth once said that, when younger, you would expect that, someday, you would grow up and find a world of real adults — the people who ran things with ease, efficiency, the perfect members of society. But these people never existed, and never will exist. Instead, you would find yourself in a world full of tall children, some more and some less tall than others. A world of tall, stupid children who had no idea where to go or what to do next. <i>But nobody ever tells</i>.<br><br> This was the reality Hillary Clinton would come face to face with.<br><br> In 2008, she ran. She ran, she bled, she lost. No soaring rhetoric about “cracks in the glass ceiling” could easily patch over the void she carried afterward — the very same void that had followed her for years, from 1800 Center Street all the way to the White House. She had spent her life chasing a fantasy of competence, of order, of, well, <i>grownups</i>. And when she got close enough to touch the machinery, she found it leaking oil, held together with little more than duct tape and prayer. And soon, she was thrown down the hill she thought she once owned. It was terrifying.<br><br> Now, here she was, on another campaign, yet another death march through town halls, back-room fundraisers, half-convinced she could fool the fates by smiling wider. She couldn’t be sure if she was campaigning for president or running from the gnawing certainty that it didn’t matter anymore. And still, she ran. Because the terrible secret of adulthood is not that nobody’s in charge, no, — it’s that someone still <i>has</i> to try anyway.<br><br> This is the story she told herself, because stories are how we survive. Without stories, there is only noise, and noise does not last forever. And because even if the ending was written by other hands, she could still choose the voice that read it aloud.<br><br> If only for a little while. </p>",
            "summary": "<p>She’s doing this again. After everything, it comes down to <i>this.</i></p>\n\n<p>Contrary to her initial predictions, Hillary Clinton is facing off Donald Trump in the 2016 election.\nHer credentials have blown many candidates out of the water; she was First Lady, Senator from New York, and Secretary of State. Trump, although well-known among the American public, lacks the credentials, ability, and support to serve in such a powerful position. At least, this is how she sees it.</p><p>Her goal is to keep him out of his league — which should be an easy feat. It’s simple enough, right?</p>",

I worked on it during January-February 2025 and, during one of my many delays while writing it, thought of doing a The Campaign Trail scenario about it for fun, and "2016b" (not to be confused with another similarly-named scenario) was born. <i>Et voilà!</i></p> <p>If you’re reading this, it means I’ve likely gone through with the scenario, but perhaps not the story. Perhaps vice versa, perhaps both. Still, I hope I’ve been able to live up to the expectations of the story, as low as they might’ve been.</p> </div> <div style="text-align:center;"> <img src="https://file.garden/aNtAfG887DiA_7lO/2016ALOT/2016b(1).jpg" style="max-height:200px;width:auto;"> </div> </div> <hr/> <p>I did not, in fact, go on with the story. A shame, really. On the other hand, I don’t wanna make it lost media, and so I’m sharing what I initially wrote for it here:</p>  <div style="font-family: 'Georgia', 'Times New Roman', serif; max-width: 800px; margin: 1em auto; padding: .5em 1em; font-size: 1.05rem; border: 1px dashed"> <p>She couldn’t believe it.</p> <p>The Governor’s Mansion in Little Rock was electric — something that was understandable given that night was, well, Election Night. Their family members, friends, and staffers were huddled over televisions, feeding updates from the networks into the campaign’s (second) war room. Somewhere in the distance, Chelsea was squealing with excitement, not too oblivious to the gravity of what was happening around her — at twelve, their daughter was old enough to understand the magnitude of what was happening, not just the <em>lede</em> of any newspaper.</p> <p>Hillary stood at the edge of the room, watching as the numbers rolled in. State after state turning blue. Bill’s name on every news ticker. <em>Governor Clinton projected to win… Clinton leading in Ohio… Clinton within reach of the presidency…</em> and many more. Wow. It <em>was</em> happening.</p> <p>It’s not that she didn’t expect it to happen, by the contrary — she expected her husband to comfortably win. Twelve years of Republican control of the White House was about to end. She could feel it. But seeing it in person was just so… surreal, for the lack of a better word. Hillary was so happy of him — so <strong>proud</strong>, too.</p> <p>She smoothed her own jacket — a deep blue one she’d chosen specifically for tonight. It fit her well, she thought. While some could argue that the past year had been a masterclass in message discipline, Hillary knew she also needed to maintain her own identity. She wasn’t all about “baking cookies and standing by her man”, no no. She wanted to show the American public she could be both: a professional woman <em>and</em> a political wife.</p> <p>The TV droned in the background as more results trickled in. Bill was in the next room with George Stephanopoulos, a friend and key member of his campaign team, alongside the rest of the team, probably pacing as usual. Given him, he was likely already thinking about transition plans. This was no real surprise; he’d been like this in ‘78, in ‘82, in ‘84 — but this was different.</p> <p>This wasn’t the Arkansas governor’s mansion. This was the <em>presidency</em>. Of what she genuinely thought was the greatest nation on Earth. Sure, it wasn’t perfect, but it was her country. And despite what the columnists wrote, despite what the Republicans claimed, this had always been their shared dream. Not his dream that she supported — but their dream that they’d built together, right from those first days at Yale when they’d talk late into the night about how to change the world.</p> <p>And despite all of this, she wondered if she was even capable of doing so — of contributing just the littlest bit to it. Hillary wanted to feel the joy everyone else seemed to be feeling — and to some extent she was — but she wondered if the rest of it was coming. Or not yet.</p> <p>“Looks like it’s happening,” a familiar voice said behind her. It was James Carville, grinning like he’d just won the lottery.</p> <p>“Looks that way,” she replied, forcing a smile.</p> <p>He tilted his head, studying her for a few seconds or so. “You don’t seem too thrilled, Hill. Something I should know?”</p> <p>Hillary shook her head. “No, it’s just…” she hesitated, searching for the right words. “It’s a lot to take in. That’s all.”</p> <p>Carville nodded, his expression softening. “I get it. Big moment. Big changes. But you’ve been ready for this longer than a lot of us. Hell, probably longer than Bill.”</p> <p>She laughed, despite herself. “Oh, don’t let him hear you say that.”</p> <p>“He knows it. We all do.” He winked, and then he was gone, swallowed up by the crowd as someone dragged him toward a TV screen. Just as rapidly as he showed up.</p> <hr> <p>Her room was cramped with boxes and half-packed suitcases. Hillary sat on the edge of the bed, staring at a pair of Chelsea’s sneakers that had been left in the corner. Bill was in the other room, on the phone with someone important — she didn’t know who, and she didn’t ask.</p> <p>But she could already imagine what it’d be about. <em>He won</em>.</p> <p>At this point in time, he’d probably have been assembling his own administration. Although she did not have much input into that, there were a few names in her mind that she’d definitely pass over to him.</p> <p>Her own landline phone sat on the nightstand, blinking with missed calls. Congratulations from an unbelievable amount of friends and colleagues. If she looked hard enough, she’d probably find that her mother called her, too. Probably something along the lines of “he will do well, sweetheart, and so will you”.</p> <p>Hillary wanted to believe her. And maybe she was right. But the truth was, she didn’t know what great things looked like anymore. For years, her life had been at least partially defined by Bill’s ambitions, by his campaigns, his charisma and his relentless drive. She’d told herself it was a partnership, that she was just as much a part of their success as he was. And she believed that — mostly.</p> <p>But now, standing on the precipice of something so much bigger than either of them, she couldn’t shake the feeling that she was losing something, too. A part of her, one could say — the version of herself she’d imagined when she was young and idealistic and ready to change the world. It was ironic, too; this was probably the closest she’d get to ever achieving any of her goals, and yet a part of her felt… confused.</p> <p>It was a strange feeling.</p> <p>By that point, Bill walked in the room, his tie loosened and his sleeves rolled up. “Hey,” he said, sitting beside her. “You okay?”</p> <p>She nodded, but he wasn’t convinced.</p> <p>“Come on, sweetheart,” he said, his voice soft. “Talk to me.”</p> <p>She hesitated, then looked at him. “Well, I’m just… I’m trying to figure out what my role is going to be in all of this. What I want it to be. It’s just a lot to process.”</p> <p>Bill frowned, as if the question had never occurred to him. “Your role? You’re my partner. You always have been. We’re going to do this together.”</p> <p>Hillary smiled, but it didn’t reach her eyes. “Yeah, I know. But I also know how <em>this</em> works. The First Lady isn’t supposed to have her own agenda. People might find it weird-”</p> <p>“They’ll like you,” he said confidently. “Once they get to know you, they’ll see what I see.”</p> <p>She wasn’t so sure. But as she leaned her head against his shoulder, she decided she didn’t have to figure it all out tonight.</p> <hr> <h2>1993</h2> <h3>January 20</h3> <p>It was a bright, although rather cold, day. There was a sharp wind slicing through the layers of coats, scarves, and hats that blanketed the crowds on the National Mall. Hillary stood on the platform, her gloved hands clasped tightly together — her breath easily visible in the frigid January air, just like everyone else’s. She wasn’t cold, though. Not only her navy blue coat kept her just warm enough, but adrenaline had long since overpowered the weather.</p> <p>Bill was just a few feet away, his hand raised, repeating the words of Chief Justice William Rehnquist. His voice was steady, confident, maybe resolute — the same voice that had carried him through the campaign, naturally.</p> <p><em>“…preserve, protect, and defend the Constitution of the United States.”</em></p> <p><em>“So help me God.”</em></p> <p>It didn’t take long for the crowd to erupt in cheers, a rolling wave of applause and shouts and the unmistakable sound of history being made. Every inauguration was special, sure, but this one was even more so because she was <em>there</em> for it. It was her husband being inaugurated, too, so special might’ve been an understatement. Hillary clapped along, a smile fixed firmly on her face as Bill turned to wave at the sea of faces below.</p> <p>What a ride. And they had so much to do that day…</p> <p>On their eleventh inaugural ball of the day (and luckily, the last one), amid the swirl of laughter and clinking glasses, Bill caught Hillary’s eye. Her violet silk dress — a deep, bruise-purple that admittedly, whispered <em>royalty</em> more than <em>First Lady</em> — swirled as Bill spun her, his hand firm at her waist. In that charged moment, as if the rest of the world had quieted to leave just the two of them, the band began the first few bars of “It Had to Be You.”</p> <p>As he dipped her low, she felt his breath warm against her ear. “<em>You</em> picked this color to drive me crazy, didn’t you?”</p> <p>She laughed, though her feet throbbed. “You picked the song.”</p> <p>“Guilty.”</p> <p>By the time the ball ended and they returned to the White House, Hillary was so exhausted she could barely think straight. Besides the eleven balls they had just gone to, she’d also gone to several other events just days before the inauguration, met with a variety of A-list pop stars, and couldn’t even stand on her feet anymore. And even through the fog of fatigue, she felt the weight of the moment pressing down on her.</p> <p>The second floor of the White House — their new residence — was fairly quiet when they arrived. The staff had done their best to make it feel like home, arranging furniture, unpacking some essentials, even leaving fresh flowers on the tables. But it still felt somewhat foreign, like they were guests in someone else’s house. She wasn’t gonna get used to this for a while.</p> <p>Chelsea had fallen asleep in the car and had to be carried upstairs by a Secret Service agent. Hillary followed, watching as her daughter was tucked into bed. She lingered in the doorway for a moment, watching the rise and fall of Chelsea’s small chest, her face soft and peaceful in sleep.</p> <p>It was past two in the morning when they finally collapsed into bed.</p> <p>Bill was sleeping in his usual position, facing the wall. He was already snoring softly, one arm flung over his face. Meanwhile, Hillary lay wide awake, staring up at the ornate ceiling of their bedroom — lit by the faint glow of D.C. streetlights bleeding through the curtains. Even with the silence of the night creeping in around them, there was this hum echoing in her mind. It was hard to explain.</p> <p>For a long while, she fidgeted, adjusting the pillows, turning her body from side to side; she was kinda surprised her husband didn’t notice it. She was definitely tired, but also far from comfortable. It wasn’t an issue with her pillow or the mattress — if anything, she <em>definitely</em> wouldn’t be complaining about it! — but she was overthinking about so many things she wondered if she was even prepared for it.</p> <p><em>Maybe for some of it</em>, she thought. It’s not like she could be prepared for everything, naturally — there were just some things Hillary could never predict. Though she’d never want to, say, outshine Bill, she knew that she could do things differently.</p> <p>Then there was the magnitude of it all. She was now an international figure. The eyes of the whole world were on her. People had already started to ask, “What will the First Lady do?” and many, many more questions. The weight of history was suddenly very real, and she was expected to carry not only her husband’s legacy but also her own, creating something new out of the remnants of what had been. It wouldn’t be so hard, right?</p> <p>Hillary let out a slow breath, feeling as though the weight of everything — whatever it could be — just intensified. This wasn’t just a personal transition — this was a national chapter, one in which she played an undeniable, yet somewhat uncertain, role. Was she ready for this? Did she even <em>want</em> to be fully ready for all this change? The international spotlight, the expectations from every part of the world — it was thrilling and overwhelming all at once.</p> <p>Maybe she was just overreacting.</p> <p>But a part of her disagreed.</p></div> </span> <span id="rpage1" style="display: none;"> <h4>Recommended readings</h4> <ul> <li>Dennis W. Johnson and Lara Brown (editors) - <a href="https://www.routledge.com/Campaigning-for-President-2016-Strategy-and-Tactics/Johnson-Brown/p/book/9781138058477" target="_blank">Campaigning for President 2016: Strategy and Tactics</a>: excellent book that summarizes the events of the 2016 campaign. It includes an analysis of all the major candidates for both the Democratic and Republican parties, and it includes not only results from the primaries, but also exit polls, campaign spending, advisors, Super PAC spending, the tactics used by each campaign, and much more. Here is a brief snippet: <blockquote>“<i>While it still seemed even into the evening hours of Election Day that Hillary Clinton would pull off a win, in hindsight, the Comey letter allowed for depressed turnout among Democrats, for moderate Republican suburban women who did not want to support Trump to give him a second look, for progressives who were already leaning towards supporting a third party candidate to go ahead and do so, and ultimately for Trump to turn out just enough more votes in Pennsylvania, Michigan, and Wisconsin, to win the electoral votes in each state, and therefore the presidency.</i>”</blockquote></li> <li>Valerie M. Hudson and Patricia Leidl - <a href="https://cup.columbia.edu/book/the-hillary-doctrine/9780231539104/" target="_blank">The Hillary Doctrine: Sex and American Foreign Policy</a>: although not exactly about the 2016 election, it comments on Hillary’s tenure as the U.S. Secretary of State and especially on the “Hillary Doctrine”. This doctrine established the empowerment of women as a force for both domestic and international peace and also focused on the rights of women in the world — and Hillary’s involvement in it. It’s not an easy read, and there are some descriptions here that may make readers uncomfortable, but it was enlightening for me. Here is a brief snippet: <blockquote>"“<i>Prior to the Clinton administration, women had been conceptualized primarily as victims; during the Clinton administration, the concept of women as beings with rights deserving of protection was advanced. However, one more step was necessary, which <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_Security_Council_Resolution_1325" target="_blank">UNSCR 1325</a> represents—that is seeing women as important agents of security and peace.</i>”</blockquote> </li> <li>Jonathan Allen and Amie Parnes - <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Shattered-Inside-Hillary-Clintons-Campaign/dp/0553447084" target="_blank">Shattered: Inside Hillary Clinton’s Doomed Campaign</a>: perhaps one of the most famous books (if not the most?) about the 2016 campaign, it highlights that the failure of the second Clinton campaign was caused, alongside other factors, by her campaign’s incompetence. Here is a snippet: <blockquote><i>Obama had shown, in the face of criticism, that he understood the importance of downtime—a round on the golf course, even a smoke break—but that just wasn’t in Hillary’s DNA.<br/>It’s quite a stretch from now to November, Obama said. You’ve got to make sure you rest. Take a vacation.<br/>I know, Hillary said. I know, I know. I’ve got to do that.<br/>But she didn’t really know how to slow down; left to her own devices, she would run herself into the ground.</i></blockquote> </li> <li>John F. Harris - <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Survivor-Bill-Clinton-White-House/dp/0375508473" target="_blank">The Survivor: Bill Clinton in the White House</a>: although not a book about the Hillary campaign, it does talk about a couple of events and issues from the Clinton administration mentioned in this mod, including but not limited to: the Hillarycare proposal, foreign incidents in Serbia, Somalia and Rwanda, and a couple of figures who also appear in some of the advisor images! Here is a snippet: <blockquote><i>Irresponsible in his private life, Clinton had a deep sense of responsibility in his public life. The Lewinsky scandal had shown that private failures had public consequences, but not in this instance. “Do not give me political advice or personal advice about the timing. That’s my problem. Let me worry about it,” he told his national security team.<br/>He dealt with his other worry the next morning.<br/><br/>As Hillary Clinton later recounted the painful moment, he paced back and forth by the bed before coming to the point of his confession. She was as angry as he feared. “What do you mean?” she gasped. “What are you saying? Why did you lie to me?”<br/><br/>“I’m sorry. I’m so sorry. I was trying to protect you and Chelsea.”</i></blockquote> </li> <li>Bill Clinton - <a href="https://www.amazon.com/My-Life-Bill-Etc-Clinton/dp/140003003X" target="_blank">My Life</a>: see above. Although more of a memoir, it does bring up a couple of events from Bill Clinton’s viewpoint, and is particularly useful for anyone who wants to know more about what defined the Clintons. Here is a snippet: <blockquote><i>About three weeks after the election, I had received a remarkable letter from Robert McNamara, who, as secretary of defense under Presidents Kennedy and Johnson, had prosecuted the Vietnam War. He had been moved to write me by a news story he read about my friendship with my Oxford roommate Frank Aller, who had resisted the draft and had killed himself in 1971. This is what he said:<br/><br/>For me—and I believe for the nation as well—the Vietnam war finally ended the day you were elected president. By their votes, the American people, at long last, recognized that the Allers and the Clintons, when they questioned the wisdom and morality of their government’s decisions relating to Vietnam, were no less patriotic than those who served in uniform. The anguish with which you and your friends debated our actions in 1969 was painful for you then and, I am sure, the resurrection of the issues during the campaign reopened old wounds. But the dignity with which you met the attacks, and your refusal to draw back from the belief that it is the responsibility of all citizens to question the basis for any decision to send our youth to war, has strengthened the nation for all time.</i></blockquote> </li> <li>Hillary Clinton - <a href="https://www.amazon.com/What-Happened-Hillary-Rodham-Clinton/dp/1501175564" target="_blank">What Happened</a>: a memoir about Hillary’s experiences as the 2016 Democratic nominee, including commentary on her loss. If you’re interested in her own point of view towards the election and issues throughout the campaign, this book is for you. Here is a snippet: <blockquote><i>A spirited discussion ensued. Eventually I asked the speechwriters to take another crack at a draft that was shorter and more gracious but not sugarcoated.<br/><br/>Bill was watching Trump’s speech on television. He couldn’t believe it. Neither could I. Eventually everyone left, and it was just us. I hadn’t cried yet, wasn’t sure if I would. But I felt deeply and thoroughly exhausted, like I hadn’t slept in ten years. We lay down on the bed and stared at the ceiling. Bill took my hand, and we just lay there.</i></blockquote> </li>  </ul> <h4>Issue recommendations</h4> <p> While playing this mod, you might’ve stumbled upon several issues, people, or events of interest that were either brought up during the 2016 campaign, during the second Obama administration (2013-2017) or at any point in American politics in the 25 years before that election.

This is a question that, as time goes on, fewer and fewer people can answer with certainty. But I know where I was: in my home, doing absolutely nothing. Although I always liked tracking elections, in particular, elections in my home country of Brazil, I just wasn’t too aware of whatever was going on in the US at the time. I did, however, know a couple of things.</p><p>I was in a community at the time whose majority of users were American — in particular from key swing states like Ohio and North Carolina. A great majority of them were Hillary supporters; I only recall two, one from Louisiana and one from Michigan, who endorsed Trump. The latter user believed that Trump, as a businessman, would be able to lead the country just like he led his businesses: efficiently. Most other users were against him for a variety of reasons, but two of them in particular were worried because their parents immigrated to America; they feared that, if he won, their parents would be deported, and so would they.</p><p>I did not see this discussion, however, because I was three hours ahead of them and was sleeping for most of it. On that November 9, 2016, I woke up unaware of what had actually happened. It was only in my dad’s car, when he turned on the radio, and he switched to a local program, that I found out that Hillary Clinton, despite what almost everyone thought until then, had <i>lost</i>. This was around 6:30 a.m. my time, so it had been about an hour since the election was called for Trump. I studied in the mornings, so when I arrived at school right before 7:00 a.m, my classmates — who all had varying levels of interest in U.S. politics —, were, until then, certain of at least one thing: that Clinton was going to win. To many of them, Trump was seen as a joke, and the only thing they could recall from his campaign proposals was that he was going to “build a wall”, that Mexico would pay for it, and that was really it.</p> <p>I remember they were just as shocked as I was. It just hadn’t crossed our minds that it could happen — and in the minds of many people, too; Trump himself said he didn’t think he would win — and now that it had, it was hard to see what would happen next. We were all in this somber mood, and it seems funny in retrospect, but at the time, most of us were either 12 or 13. I was just three weeks away from turning 13! (And now I’m old.)</p> <hr/> <p> Several years later, <i>2016: A Lifetime of This</i> was made. I’d never expected to make a The Campaign Trail mod, and I made it mostly as a proof of concept that I <i>could</i> do it with the tools the community had, just like most modders had done over the years. And then I got carried away. I mentioned this in the very first mod announcement post, but I always liked the original TCT scenarios. A couple of years back they used to be paywalled, and so the only elections you could play were 1860, 1916, 1976, and 2016a. The 2016a mod, while pretty simple, was really neat for the time because it contained elements the 2016 version didn’t have: the randomized questions. A strategy for easily winning as Trump at the time, however, involved a lot of luck; you needed three terrorist attacks to boost your campaign, although a victory otherwise was not impossible. It’s why I initially named this mod 2016b, at least before realizing there already was a 2016b. And a 2016c. And a 2016d. Because 2016e just wouldn’t cut it, I had to remove that part.</p> <p> But here we are now. </p> </span> <span id="rpage3" style="display: none;">  <h4>Notes on the in-game code</h4> <ul><li>The tooltip system was taken from <i>W.</i> and rewritten for this mod. The design for the tooltips was, if I remeber correctly, taken from <i>2021DE</i>, although I had a similar design for tooltips on own personal site and brought it here.</li> <li>The music player you see here was initially rewritten from the same one on <i>W.</i>, although it was rewritten to the point where it’s significantly different (this player runs by grabbing songs directly from YouTube using the YouTube iFrame API).</li> <li>The initial opening message code and the ending page system were taken from <i>Things That Never Were</i>. Both were rewritten, especially the latter, as I was genuinely unable to understand how it worked without removing a dozen other custom in-game attributes.</li> <li>The Dossier system mechanic was inspired by the 1991 DOS game <i>Floor 13</i> (which can be played <a href="https://www.myabandonware.com/game/floor-13-1eo/play-1eo" target="_blank">here</a>), which allowed you to do a variety of tools, from interrogating subjects to abducting them to ransacking places to discrediting their reputation. It was a game I especially played a lot, so I’m happy with how it turned otu here. (A more family-friendly version of it was implemented on this mod.) The layout for the Dossier was partially inspired by that of <i>Things That Never Were</i>, especially the Republican primaries.</li> <li>The tabs system you’re seeing here was taken from <i>2004 Sundance</i> and rewritten for this mod. It turns out that writing a long wall of text you would definitely not read here was not a reasonable idea, and so we divided that wall of text into four, smaller fences of text.</li> <li>The question randomizer here, although using the same function as <i>bunnyhop</i> does on the aforementioned mod, is different from that one in that it allowed me to do the changes here without altering the overall format of the mod.</li> <li>Finally, the checkbox styling you see here was partially taken from the one on that mod and changed for this one.</li><li>Many of the images here were listed on sites such as Getty Images. This mod is primarily a humorous/educational mod, and we want to note these are being labeled as fair use of the respective material under United States copyright law.</li></ul><h4>Special thanks to…</h4> <ul><li><i>Spacecowboyguy</i> — for creating the banners for Booker, Patrick & the other running mates;</li><li><i>Hogwildin1</i> — for suggesting the sabotage idea to help Johnson in the Western states;</li><li><i>astrohuncho</i> — for the Further Reading Wizard, which I’m using to write this message as we speak;</li><li><i>Jet’s TCT Mod Tool</i> — for making development of this much less tedious;</li><li>The man himself, <i>Dan Bryan</i> — for creating this neat educational game;</li><li><i>Everyone who playtested this mod</i> — for, well, trying out this mod and sharing their feedback;</li></ul>  <p>And of course, thanks to <b>you</b>, for taking the time to read all of this. :D I appreciate it!</p> <hr style="border:solid 1px lightgray"> <blockquote>"Let us be like a bird,<br/>perched for a moment,<br/>on the frailest of branches,<br/>that feels it bend,<br/>but sings anyway,<br/>because it knows it has wings."</blockquote> </span></div>`,
